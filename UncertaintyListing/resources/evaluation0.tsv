E4	Phosphorylation	activates	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E4	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	In the MAPK cascade, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK.	false	Certain
E5	Phosphorylation	activate	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E5	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	MEK is the only enzyme known to activate ERK and being located downstream of Ras, and Raf has therefore been identified as an attractive therapeutic target within this central cascade.	false	Certain
E6	Phosphorylation	activates	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E6	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	Activated MEK activates ERK, which induces several proliferative and survival processes, one of which is activation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex (discussed above) upon translocation to the nucleus.	false	Certain
E7	Phosphorylation	inhibit	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E7	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	Conversely, MEK inhibitors inhibit ERK phosphorylation in all cells, potentially leading to toxicity caused by suppression of P-ERK in normal tissues, and consequently limiting the dose that can be administered in patients.	false	Certain

E9	Phosphorylation	activates	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E9	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	MEK then phosphorylates and activates ERK, allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates transcriptional factors permitting the expression of a variety of genes.	false	Certain
E10	Phosphorylation	activate	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E10	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	The BRAFV600E mutation directly leads to activation of MEK although other mutations in BRAF appear to indirectly activate ERK through CRAF and not MEK (Wan et al 2004).	false	Uncertain
E11	Phosphorylation	activates	Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK_E11	/tmp/Phosphorylation_MEK_ERK.txt	The B-Raf kinase is activated by GTP-Ras in response to growth factors and phosphorylates MEK, which in turn activates ERK to phosphorylate downstream targets such as kinases and transcription factors that promote cell division [30].	false	Certain
